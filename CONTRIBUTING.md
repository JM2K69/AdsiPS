# Contributing to ADSIPS module

Contributions are welcome via pull requests and issues. Before submitting a pull request, please make sure all tests pass.

## Environment Setup

```powershell
# First time execution
## Install requirements and Run the build task
./build.ps1 -InstallDependencies -verbose`

# Re-Running the build task
./build.ps1 -verbose -task build

# Running the test task
## As of 2020/09 this only works with up to Pester 4.10.0
./build.ps1 -verbose -task test

# Running the script analyzer task
./build.ps1 -verbose -task analyze
```


## Guidelines

* Don't use Write-Host
* Use Verb-Noun format, Check Get-Verb for approved verb
* Always use explicit parameter names, don't assume position
* Don't use Aliases
* Should support Credential input
* If you want to show informational information use Write-Verbose
* If you use Verbose, show the name of the function, you can do this:

```powershell
# Define this variable a the beginning
$ScriptName = (Get-Variable -name MyInvocation -Scope 0 -ValueOnly).Mycommand

# Show your verbose message this way
Write-Verbose -Message "[$ScriptName] Querying system X"
```

* You need to have Error Handling (TRY/CATCH)
* Return terminating error using ```$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($_)```
* Think about the next guy, document your function, help them understand what you are achieving, give at least one example
* Implement appropriate WhatIf/Confirm support if you function is changing something
