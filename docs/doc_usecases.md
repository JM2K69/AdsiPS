# Use Cases

1. Learning Active Directory: We can't see the code behind the Microsoft ActiveDirectory Module and Quest ActiveDirectory Snapin. This module is a great way to explore and learn on how Active Directory is working,
1. Delegation: Active Directory queries need to be performed by a tool (GUI for example) and you don't want it to load AD module. Additionally you don't know who will use the tool and if they have/can/know how to install the module,
1. Performance:  ADSI is faster,
1. Restricted environment: Sometime ActiveDirectory Module is not available/ or can't install it on a machine.
